Human Emotion Detection System Using Machine Learning This project implements a real-time human emotion detection system that identifies facial emotions from live webcam feed using machine learning. The model is trained on a labeled emotion dataset (e.g., FER-2013 or CK+) and uses a pre-trained classifier (such as SVM, CNN, or Random Forest)
